The goal of this project was to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application allows users to create and view blog posts. Posts do not persist between sessions as no database was used in this version of the application. After cloning the project, run npm i on your terminal to install all the necessary modules. Then run nodemon index.js to start the server and you can then interact with the application on http://localhost:3000/
